        <h2>Overview of Farmer Suicides in India</h2>
        <p>
            India, an agrarian country with more than half of its population depending on agriculture, has been facing a grave issue of farmer suicides for several decades. This issue reflects the deep-rooted agrarian crisis influenced by economic distress, indebtedness, crop failures, and insufficient government support. The seriousness of this matter is hard to overlook, as it affects the lives and livelihoods of the very people we rely on to feed the nation.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Key Statistics</h3>
        <p>
            Since the 1990s, India has witnessed an alarming rise in farmer suicides. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), more than 300,000 farmers have committed suicide between 1995 and 2015. In 2019 alone, 10,281 cases of farmer suicides were reported, accounting for nearly 7.4% of total suicides in the country.
        </p>

        <h3>Causes of Farmer Suicides</h3>
        <p>
            The causes of farmer suicides are multi-dimensional and complex:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> Indebtedness, low income from crops, land fragmentation.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental and Climatic Factors:</strong> Crop failures, water scarcity, droughts.</li>
            <li><strong>Social and Psychological Factors:</strong> Social pressure, mental health issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Government Policies and Market Issues:</strong> Policy gaps, market monopolies, lack of insurance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Impact of Farmer Suicides</h3>
        <p>
            The impact of farmer suicides is devastating on families and communities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> Families are left with outstanding loans, plunging them into further poverty.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Impact:</strong> Children often drop out of school, and the psychological toll on surviving family members is immense.</li>
            <li><strong>Migration:</strong> Many farmers migrate to cities for alternative livelihoods, exacerbating urban overpopulation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Farmer suicides are not just a statistic; they reflect a much larger crisis affecting millions of lives. Farmers are the backbone of our nation, often referred to as "annadatas" (providers of food), and it is imperative that we understand the seriousness of their struggles. Only through a collective effort—one that includes financial reform, improved irrigation infrastructure, mental health support, and market restructuring—can we bring real and lasting change to our farmers' lives. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As you read this, remember: farmers are not just workers in a field. They are the foundation of our sustenance, and as a society, we owe them our support and recognition. In many ways, a farmer is indeed like God to the people, for they give us the gift of life through food.
